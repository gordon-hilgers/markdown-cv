## Currently

Techlead and developer at Priva working on making data more available and insightful through the Azure Cloud platform. 

## About me

From a young age I've been interested in technology, discovering new things and how they work, so doing a bachelor in Electrical Engineering was an easy choice. During my Bachelor I discovered that programming was more my thing than hardware development, so I gradually moved towards programming and higher programming languages, like C# which I work most often with.
Besides my work I love food, friends and cooking, preferably all together. With these things I have the same curiosity, I want to know what makes food taste great, how to prepare it and discovering new dishes and flavours. To keep fit (a bit) I like to go bouldering with my girlfriend and other friends and Thai-boxing to blow off some steam.
