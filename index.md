## About me

From a young age I've been interested in technology, discovering new things and how they work, so doing a bachelor in Electrical Engineering was an easy choice. During my Bachelors I discovered that programming was more my thing than hardware development, so I gradually moved towards programming and higher programming languages, like C# which I am most experienced in.

Besides my work I love cooking, spending time with friends, riding my motor bike, cuddling with my pet rats, and listening to live music. With cooking I have the same curiosity as with work, I want to know what makes food taste great, how to prepare it and discovering new dishes and flavours. To keep fit (a bit) I like to go bouldering with my girlfriend and other friends and Thai-boxing to blow off some steam.
